Our little fluff ball, Fozzie Bear, is available for adoption! He is super cute, but he is also super puppy! Active, inquisitive, destructive, mouthy, and not potty-trained, to name a few of his puppy traits. 
Fozzie will likely be around 20 lbs full grown. That's our best guess, no guarantees. He will also require constant grooming and haircuts.
